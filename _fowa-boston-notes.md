Hardware for the Soft World: Real Time Connections with IoT
STACEY MULCAHY

* IoT frameworks + dev

Leverage your JavaScript skills to explore the land of hardware and get your feet wet in the Internet of Things. A survey of libraries or frameworks such as Spacebrew, Johnny-five, Cylon.js and Nitrogen.js as well as hardware, will be examined to understand this growing space of the IoT.

Putting Real-Time into Practice
DAN FRIEDMAN

* Socket.IO dev

So you walk out of this conference inspired by a talk, but when you sit down to build something, you don’t know where to start. Learning a new set of technologies and techniques often takes months when it should take days or weeks. By teaching real-time development (specifically, Socket.io with Express) to a thousand engineers, we’ve learned how to start making real-time apps without going back to school for a month. We’ll talk about how to quickly learn new technologies with a focus on real-time development with Socket.io.

Surviving the Perfect Enterprise Storm: Designing Real-Time Data Applications in Complex Organizations
RIAN VAN DER MERWE

* analytics, location data, and presence/typing data in IM applications
* good end user experience for real-time data apps

Designing for the enterprise is really, really hard. The reason it’s hard is that in most cases the people who buy the software and the people who use the software are completely different, and therefore have completely different needs. In fact, the only thing that may be harder is designing with real-time data. Put those two environments together, and things can get stormy really quickly. The problem with enterprise software is that the people who buy it — IT managers, HR managers, etc. — care about things like configurability, control, more features than a competitor, and most of all: the ability to customize the thing just so, so that it fits in with whatever systems already exist. End users care about none of those things. They care about getting a job done as quickly and with as little pain as possible. Once you have to deal with real-time data as well — such as analytics, location data, and presence/typing data in IM applications — the difficulty of the buyer vs user dynamic gets even more complicated because of all the complexity inherent in making tons of data usable and useful. So how do you design in this kind of hostile environment? How do you provide a good end user experience for real-time data apps while also catering to the needs of the business to sell to a different kind of audience? That’s what this talk is about. You’ll learn how to balance the needs of different product audiences effectively; how to bring user-centered design and Lean UX principles to the slow-moving machine that is the enterprise market; how to design useful and usable interfaces with complex data sets when buyers expect it to be packed with (possibly less useful) features; and how to turn a sales-driven organization into a product-driven organization (or at least how to co-exist peacefully). Trust me — enterprise software has never been this fun!

Pretty Pictures: Zen, Data Visualization, and the Art of Real-Time Decision Making
BRANDON SATROM

* all this data we’re logging
* pass/fail reports
* run GPS data or the calories we’ve been tracking
* Foursquare check-ins, and all those tasty beverages we’re logging on Untappd
* simple visualizations or by leveraging data to modify behavior through gamification
* strategies for building real time apps
* ways to build powerful visualizations and systems of automated intelligence and decision-making that can reveal new insights from the data your apps create

So what are we doing with all this data we’re logging, anyway? By data, are we talking about the heartbeat messages from our web-servers; the build results from our CI servers; the pass/fail reports from our automated tests? Or, are we talking about daily step counts; bike and run GPS data or the calories we’ve been tracking for the last six months? Or is it about our Foursquare check-ins, and all those tasty beverages we’re logging on Untappd? There’s no doubt that we’re capturing a mountain of data in our work and personal lives. We’ve got the data ingestion side of the story pretty much figured out. On the data analysis side, we’ve just begun the journey—mostly through simple visualizations or by leveraging data to modify behavior through gamification. But simple pictures and games are just a start. When we see data not as an end, but a means to something more, we can combine, remix and leverage it in ways that takes us toward our real goal: data as information for change. In this session, Brandon will explore strategies for building real time apps, as well as ways to build powerful visualizations and systems of automated intelligence and decision-making that can reveal new insights from the data your apps create.
